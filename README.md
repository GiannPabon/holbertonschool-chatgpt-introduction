# ChatGPT - Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency

## Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for the **Foundations v2 - Part 2** project, a module focused on integrating AI into software development practices. By leveraging ChatGPT, this project enhances debugging efficiency, automates repetitive tasks, and improves overall code quality. The tasks reflect real-world programming scenarios, helping developers embrace AI-driven productivity tools.

---

## Objectives

1. **Debugging:** Identify and resolve code errors in Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
2. **Automation:** Utilize AI for generating boilerplate code, documentation, and unit tests.
3. **Documentation:** Write clear and structured documentation for codebases.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust mechanisms to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.

---

## Features

- **Debugging Code Samples:**
  - Python scripts for factorials, Minesweeper, and Tic Tac Toe.
  - HTML/JavaScript integration for interactive web features.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Add safeguards against invalid inputs in Python applications.
- **Automation:**
  - Generate and optimize boilerplate code using ChatGPT.
- **Documentation:**
  - Include comprehensive function descriptions, parameters, and return explanations.
